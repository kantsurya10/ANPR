# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System

## Overview

This project is an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system that utilizes machine learning techniques to detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images or video streams. The system is designed to be robust, accurate, and efficient, making it suitable for various applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and toll collection systems.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Capable of processing video feeds or images to detect and recognize number plates in real-time.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on a diverse dataset to ensure high accuracy across different environments and conditions.
- **Scalable**: Easily integrable with other systems and adaptable to different use cases.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Tesseract OCR**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anpr-system.git
   cd anpr-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up Tesseract OCR**:
   - Download and install Tesseract OCR from [here](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
   - Ensure that Tesseract is added to your systemâ€™s PATH.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open the `ANPR_project.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
   - Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess images, and run the ANPR system.

2. **Test the System**:
   - You can test the system on sample images or video files.
   - The recognized license plates will be displayed along with the processed images.

## Model Training

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Organize your dataset with images and corresponding annotations.
   - Preprocess the images as per the instructions in the notebook.

2. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the training cells in the notebook to train the model from scratch or fine-tune an existing model.

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   - Use the evaluation script in the notebook to assess the model's performance.

## Results

- The system achieves a high level of accuracy and can effectively detect and recognize number plates from various angles and lighting conditions.
- Example output:
